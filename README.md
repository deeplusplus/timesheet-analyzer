# Menlo Timesheet Analyser
This is currently a humble set of scripts for parsing Menlo-formatted timesheets into Pandas DataFrames. Very little effort went into parsing correctly, so look at your results before drawing broad conclusions. 

Please make whatever changes you want to this code. Everything is experimental.

## Setup
1. Pull repository
2. Create virtual environment (or not, it's your computer)
3. Install dependencies `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Put your timesheets in a folder in the root directory called `input_files`

## To Run the Dashboard
To run the web dashboard, enter this in the terminal: `streamlit run dashboard.py`
